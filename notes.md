# Notes

## Classes
- need to build a data structure containing all methods
- handle static methods with @classmethod decorator

## Functions vs. Classes
- start by creating a list of functions in a particular scope
- if those functions have their prototype modified upgrade to class
- if those functions have class methods attached upgrade to class
